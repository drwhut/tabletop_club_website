<p>This... this is happening y'all. I am so excited!!</p>

<p><strong>Tabletop Club has officially entered beta!</strong> ðŸ¥³</p>
<p>I want to take the time to thank each and every person that has  helped contribute to the game, whether it was through testing the game during alpha, adding code, translating the game, suggesting ideas, or providing assets, I am so thankful to each and every one of you ðŸ˜‡</p>
<p>I also want to thank <em>you</em> for having a look at this game! It would mean the world to me if random people on the internet end up playing this game, even just to try it out. If you do, feel free to let me know what you think of the game on social media! I want this game to be as good as it can be, and I need your help to do that ðŸ™‚</p>
