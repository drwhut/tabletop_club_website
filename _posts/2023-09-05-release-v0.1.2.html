<p>Hey,  everyone! This is just a small update to renew the certificate used to  connect to the official master server, as the previous one was about to  expire.
</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> You will need to install this update (or a future update) in order to continue playing with others in multiplayer!
</p>
<p>While this update is merely a nibble, I've got a whole lot of stuff cooking in the background (by background, I really mean the <code>0.2-rewrite</code> branch), which I'll be sharing the details of soon!
</p>
<h2>Changelog</h2>
<h3>Changed</h3>
<ul><li>Updated the master server's SSL certificate.
