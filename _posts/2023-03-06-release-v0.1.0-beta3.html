<p>Hello again, I bring thoust another beta build! ðŸ¥³</p>

<p>This update is a lot smaller than Beta 2, since I've mostly been  revamping a particular feature of the game: the notebook. Now, not only  are you able to view other player's notebooks by clicking their name in  multiplayer, you can also make pages with images! These pages act a lot like PDF forms, where there are configurable textboxes over the image. This should be ideal for keeping track of scores for complicated games, or for creating things like character sheets in RPGs. Please feel free to try the new notebook out, and let me know what you think!</p>
<p>But you know what project <em>has</em> had a big update? Godot! The long-anticipated <strong>Godot 4.0</strong> came out <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/godot-4-0-sets-sail/" rel="nofollow">just a few days ago</a>, and I just wanted to say congratulations to everyone that has contributed to this amazing engine. I may be a little biased when I say  this, but in my opinion it is one of the best open-source projects ever made, and this update is a huge step in solidifying Godot's place in the game development world, not just for indie developers like myself, but for big studios as well! ðŸ¤ž</p>
<p>So you may be asking, will Tabletop Club use Godot 4? The answer is yes... eventually. Right now the main focus for v0.1.0 is stability and  the odd new feature here and there, and v0.2.0 being quality-of-life features and accessibility, so I've decided to stick with Godot 3.x for the time being, at least until Godot has hopefully become a lot more stable with 4.1 later this year. Plus, the conversion itself will take a long time, which presents an opportunity to re-write the code, and I've already got a bunch of ideas to optimise the game when the time comes.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you to everyone who contributed! Thanks to your efforts, the game is now also playable in Spanish! Â¡Muchas gracias! ðŸ¤—</p>
