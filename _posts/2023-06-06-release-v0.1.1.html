title: "Release: v0.1.1"

<p>Hey, everyone! Apologies for the long wait, but the first update for Tabletop Club is finally here! <img class="emoji" alt="partying_face" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f973.png" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>This is a relatively small patch which fixes a few bugs that players had found, as well as adding new translations from the community - in fact, so many translations were submitted that you can now play the game in both Chinese (Simplified) and Polish! <img class="emoji" alt="grin" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f601.png" width="20" height="20"> A huge thank you to everyone that contributed since the initial release, you guys are awesome!</p>
<p>Once again, apologies for this patch taking so long to get out - I had taken a break from developing the game after its initial release, but once I was ready to work on it again, I suddenly got super ill and couldn't work on the game for longer than ten minutes at a time, which was super aggravating... the issues still persist today, but thankfully they are a lot less limiting than they were. Now that the patch is out, I'm gonna try my best to work on the first major update, v0.2.0, but development may be a bit slower than anticipated due to my health.</p>
<p>So what has been changed, I hear you ask? Well, as it turns out I have a list of things that have been changed since the initial release right here! What are the chances??</p>
