<p>How do you do fellow tabletop gamers? <img class="emoji" alt="wave" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f44b.png" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>I bring a new release candidate for v0.1.0! This release is purely bug fixes this time around, mostly related to stacks of cards and  tokens. There's still some time to fix issues before v0.1.0, so make  sure you get those bug reports in while you can!</p>
<p>There's just a couple of other things I wanted to mention: quite a  few people have said they would like to have an official Discord server to join to chat with other players, so I've spent some time setting up both a <strong>Discord server</strong> as well as a <strong>Matrix space</strong> for those who want an open-source alternative, and they'll be made public soon(TM)! And for those who are on Linux, once v0.1.0 is released I'm planning to create a <strong>Flatpak</strong> version of the game, so if you're on a distribution that supports it, you can download it and  get updates straight from your software manager!</p>
<p>That's all for now! As always, have fun, and I'll hopefully chat to you all soon <img class="emoji" alt="slightly_smiling_face" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f642.png" width="20" height="20"></p>
