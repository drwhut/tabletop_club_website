title: 'Release: v0.1.0 - "Humble Beginnings"'
---
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, cats and dogs... this is the first official and <em>stable</em> release of Tabletop Club! ðŸ¥³</p>

<p>First of all, I want to thank everyone, from my friends who helped shape and test the game, to those who have contributed code, assets and translations, and to whose who have played it even for a little bit -  this genuinely would not have been possible without your support. For context, I started this project knee-deep in the middle of the COVID pandemic since I was not able to play board games face-to-face at the  time. At the same time, the various lockdowns were taking a huge toll on  my mental health, which I did not realise until it was too late; the  effects of which I am still feeling to this day. For me personally, not  only is this a project that allows me to play board games with my friends, but it is also proof. Proof that no matter how bad it gets, no matter how low your self-esteem gets, you're still worth it. You can still make a difference in the world. Even if by modern standards most would call me a "failure" or a "wreck", it's all relative. This is something I've made, and I'm damn proud of it.</p>
<h2>Looking to the future</h2>
<p>While this is an official release, it is only the first in what is (hopefully) many. There are a lot of features and quality-of-life improvements that I want to add to the game, but have not had the means or time to implement as of yet. Luckily, work on these improvements has already begun in what I call "the great rewrite", which will lay the foundations for v0.2.0 and beyond. Here's just a few of the things that are planned in future updates:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Improved behaviour for in-game objects like boards and containers.</li>
    <li>More intuitive asset pack creation and management within the game itself.</li>
    <li>An online asset pack database for creators to upload content, and for players to automatically download from.</li>
    <li>A Lua scripting API for custom behaviour.</li>
    <li>Migration to Godot 4.0, which should bring better performance and improved graphical fidelity.</li>
    <li>Expansion to more platforms, including the web and mobile devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, please do not hesitate to submit bug reports and feature requests on GitHub, every issue helps to improve the game and make it more accessible to players. If you want to get directly involved in the development of the game, see how you can contribute <a href="https://tabletop-club.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general/contributing/ways_to_contribute.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<h2>Itch app: Switching from <code>prerelease</code> to <code>stable</code></h2>
<p>If you have downloaded Tabletop Club in the past using the Itch app, you will have downloaded the <code>prerelease</code> branch of the game. If you wish to play this release (which is on the <code>stable</code> branch), you will first need to go to the install settings in the lower-right corner:</p>

<p>Once open, you can then install the <code>stable</code> version of the game for your platform:</p>

<p>After this, you will now start getting automatic updates for both the <code>stable</code> branch and the <code>prerelease</code> branch, and you can choose which version to run when starting the game.</p>
