            <p>Congratulations, you've only gone and broke the bloody website. I hope you're happy.</p>
            <p>As punishment, please spend at least thirty seconds <a href="https://youtu.be/0Wi8Fv0AJA4" target="_blank">listening to this music</a> while you think about what you've done.</p>
            <p>Once you have spent a sufficient amount of time contemplating your actions, you can return to the <a href="/">home page</a> safe in the knowledge that you realise the error of your ways.</p>
            <p>... OK, in all seriousness, this might have actually been my fault. If it was, please <a href="https://github.com/drwhut/tabletop_club_website/issues" target="_blank">report an issue</a>. But you still need to listen to the music for at least thirty seconds.</p>
