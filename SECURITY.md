If you notice a security flaw in either the main website
([tabletopclub.net](https://tabletopclub.net)), or the official forum
([forum.tabletopclub.net](https://forum.tabletopclub.net)), please do not open
a public issue in this repository.

Instead, email me privately at <drwhut@gmail.com> as soon as possible, with
details about the flaw(s). I will try to respond and fix the issue as quickly
as I can.
